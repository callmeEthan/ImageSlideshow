There are already existing slideshow skin for rainmeter, but this skin aim to use as little performance as possible, only minus image reading/loading time.  
This skin does include effect animation (turned off by default), if image doesn't fit skin size, this skin will scale the image to fit and move it across to get the whole picture (as shown above).
